Implement this game for me in a single html file.
Output just the html content, nothing more.
Double-check if any `import` statements are used or dependencies are required,
and include them using latest CDN found in the internet.
For three.js, use: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three-js@79.0.0/three.min.js
